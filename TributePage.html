					</blockquote>

						<p>"There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living."</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination."</p>
